# Berlin Venues Project

## Introduction/Business Problem 
Berlin is becoming more popular day by day. Berlin has 12 boroughs and all of them have some characteristic places. Also, some boroughs are becoming more popular than others because of these characteristic places for example Kreuzberg. Berlin is a living city and has so many different places like shopping centers, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. All of these are some reasons for attracting people including expats and newbie startups. 

However; if you are looking for a place to set up your office, popularity might not be enough to decide. We always hear some complaints from people about the location of the office, or even in reviews on sites like Glassdoor, people consider the location of offices a minus or plus. So this particular decision, with other plus features of your small company, of course, might attract more people to work with.

We will be exploring Berlin boroughs and venues to find out where is the best place to locate your office.

## Data Description

In this project, the data will be based on Berlin location. 

 - I have a data set composed of Berlin Postal Codes, and Location (Latitude/Longitude).
 
 - I have another data set which will be combining with other later, contains Postal Codes and Boroughs of Berlin.
 
 - I will also be using Foursquare API for getting most popular venues in Berlin including their locations, categories etc.

By combining these three data sets I will be exploring, clustering and make data analysis based on combined data.
